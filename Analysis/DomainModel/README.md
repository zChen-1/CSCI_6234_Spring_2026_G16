# Domain Model
### This week, you will work on the analysis discipline of the OOAD process.
### You will create a Domain Model for your system. 
### The model will be done using UML Class Diagram.
### The model must contains the class (most of them will entity classes: no interface or control classes).
### Each class MUST have a least 1 attribute.
### Classes must connected via UML Association including inheritance when necessary.
### You must also provide an English description of your domain model from 50 to 250 words.
### You must upload the models to your GitHub in the Analysis folder under the DomainModel (no spaces) sub-folder.
### You will:
- a. Upload into Blackboard a single PowerPoint file containing the following slides:
  - a. Title of your project, group#, and student members
  - b. A paragraph describing your project (just one slide)
  - c. A slide containing the use case model developed in the previous slides (just one slide). Even if you have several use cases, your use case model must fit a single PowerPoint page. It must be readable.
  - d. Then, for each use case in your use case model (a use case model must have at least 3 and at most 7 use cases), you will provide a slide containing the robustness diagram. So if your use case model has 7 use cases, then you will have 7 slides, where each one will contain a robustness diagram
  - e. A slide containning your domain model.
- b. Your blackboard submission must also contain a clickable link to your GitHub: no picture, just the link.
- c. You will upload into GitHub under the Analysis folder the following files:
  - a. One .pdf file for your domain model (modeled as a UML Class Diagram) drawn by hand. Make sure the background of the PDF file is white with no lines or any other picture, text on it.
  - b. One .puml file 
  - c. One .png file 
  - d. The name of files must match the name of the use case
